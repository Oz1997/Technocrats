Checksums are used to ensure the integrity of a file after it has been transmitted from one storage device to another. This can be across the Internet or simply between two computers on the same network. Either way, if you want to ensure that the transmitted file is exactly the same as the source file, you can use a checksum.
The checksum is calculated using a hash function. To verify the integrity of the file, a user calculates the checksum using a checksum calculator program and then compares the two to make sure they match.
Checksums are used not only to ensure a corrupt-free transmission, but also to ensure that the file has not been tampered with. When a good checksum algorithm is used, even a tiny change to the file will result in a completely different checksum value.
The most common checksums are MD5 and SHA-1.
